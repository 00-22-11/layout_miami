# Miami landing page
1. Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the link
    - [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/layout_miami/)
2. This project requires you to work with `git` manually:
    - Fork and clone the project
    - `npm i` and `npm start` to start the development
    - `git checkout -b <branch-name>` create new branch and switch on it
    - write your code in `src` folder. `dist` is generated by `gulp` from your source files
    - `git add .` and `git commit -m 'your message'` to save you work locally
    - `git push origin <branch-name>` to send your code to github 
    - `npm run deploy` to publish you changes to `gh-pages`
    - Create a PR with `[DEMO LINK]` in the description
